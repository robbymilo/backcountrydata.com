Flow aloft is supplying a W to E storm motion\nof 50kt and showers/storms have produced widespread gusts of 45\nto 55 mph with locally higher gusts mostly across higher\nterrain. Winds and showers will diminish this evening, then ramp\nup again Wednesday morning as another upper trough pushes into\nthe region. Similar to this morning, the contour of heavier\nsnowfall will follow the terrain. Areas near the foothills into\nthe mountains see the best chance for accumulating snow. In the\nSnake Plain this will favor areas north/east of I84. Winds will\nagain ramp up across SE oregon and higher terrain of SW Idaho\nearly Wednesday with widespread gusts 45 to 55 mph. Coupled with\nthe snowfall this will make for dangerous winter driving\nconditions through late morning. In the Western Magic Valley the\nworst conditions still look to be limited to the northern\nfoothills north of Jerome/Gooding heading into the Camas\nPrairie. Precipitation tapers off Wednesday afternoon and winds\nwill relax some as the upper wave exits. Showers will continue\nin the mountains but snowfall rates drop off after late morning.\nGiven this timing have shortened ending timing on the current\nsuite of hazards. Northwest flow will keep a chance of showers\nin the mountains into Thursday while valleys catch a short break.\nThe next upper wave drops into the Pac NW on Thursday, bringing\nanother round of widespread snow to the mountains and increasing\nthe chance of snow in the valleys. Amounts are looking similar\nto recent storms and gusty winds will again accompany this\nstorm.\n\n.LONG TERM...Friday through Tuesday...Heavy snow and strong\nwinds expected Friday through Saturday night. Strong northwest\nflow will not only support strong gusts Friday\nmorning/afternoon, but also begin a significant moisture flow\nthat`ll support snowfall through Saturday. The northerly\ncomponent and a colder airmass will keep snowlevels around 1-2\nkft MSL. Precipitation may not be widespread at first, as weaker\ndynamics keep the snow over terrain, but a Pacific low moves\ninland Saturday afternoon with more moisture and favorable\nforcing. Models differ on the track of this system which hints\nthat the timing and snowfall amounts are still uncertain.\nHowever, snow accumulation is expected in all areas. NBM\nforecast totals are currently 3-7 inches in SE Oregon, 4-10\ninches in the Snake Plain, generally varying with elevation, and\n10-20 inches in mountain valleys with more on the summits. As a\nridge begins to move in following the Pacific low, the chance\nfor mixed precip in the valley increases in the evening\nSaturday. Although, models are generally trending colder, so\nthat chance may decrease. Going into Sunday the ridge builds\nthrough the period. We will stay cold under northerly flow, but\nmuch drier. A brief period of stagnant air is possible.\n\n&&\n\n.AVIATION...Scattered MVFR and local IFR conditions inside\nshowers, otherwise VFR mostly cloudy.
